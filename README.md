# Machine-learning-project
Human disease Pridiction using Machine Learning.

Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on patient data. The project involved data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.
Symptom based disease prediction.

-> Problem Statement:

1.Traditional diagnosis method is a well-versed procedure which requires the patients to go to doctor, get examined,

medical test etc. and finally conclude.

2.This process is extremely time inefficient.

-> Our Solution:

1.This project is useful to save the time required and also money for initial process of diagnosis symptoms.

it proposes anautomated disease prediction sysem based on user input.

2. The algorithm receives user input and outputs a list of probabble diseases.

->More about project:

Based on the probabilistic approach we will predict the disease using Naive Bayesian algorithm

in particular Multinomial NB as multiple symptoms are taken.

As per literature survey, This algorithm produced fullest accuracy for large dataset.

The dataset has disease as labels and symptoms for each disease.
